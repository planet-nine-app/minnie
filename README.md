# Minnie

Minnie, named for [Minnie M. Cox][wikipedia] the first black woman to serve as postmaster in the US[^1], is _not_ a miniservice as it does not serve anything.
Instead I'm not sure if there is a good computer science term for what it is, so I'll call it a magic box.
This magic box listens for emails that you should get, and pushes buttons that other computers want you to push, so that you don't have to deal with the agita of the badge saying you have four thousand emails you haven't read.

[^1]: "Minnie is most well-known for Teddy Roosevelt's involvement in her being run out of office, and subsequently out of town by white racists. This undermines the fact that not only did she serve as postmistress, but also opened a bank, and insurance company to serve her community at a time when all three of these services were at best marginally available to women and people of color in the US."
